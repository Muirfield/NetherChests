# FAQ

* Q: What happens when more than one player use the NetherChest?
* A: when a player opens a NetherChest they see their own inventory,
  not somebody elses.  However, only one player can use a NetherChest
  at a time.
* Q: It doesn't work with iProtector!
* A: I don't use iProtector.  This plugin only listens to
  _InventoryOpen_ and _InventoryClose_ (it also listens to
  _BlockPlace_ and _PlayerQuit_, but that has nothing to do with
  opening chests).  iProtector listens and **Cancels** PlayerInteract
  events.  These are fired **before** Inventory events.  So, if you
  are not able to get it to work with _iProtector_, your configuration
  is **wrong**.
